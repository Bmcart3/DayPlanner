// # JavaScript
// - Wait for DOM to be "ready", then...
//   - Create a function to update the hours
//     - Get the current hour in military time (i.e. 14 for 2pm)
//     - Loop over all of the .time-blocks
//       - Figure out which hour this block represents
//       - If this block's hour is less than the current hour:
//         - Add the class "past" to this block
//       - Else if this block's hour is the current hour:
//         - Remove "past" class from this time block
//         - Add "present" class to this time block
//       - Else
//         - Remote the "past" class from this time block
//         - Remove the "present" class from this time block
//         - Add the "future" class to this time block
//   - Call the function we just created to update the hours the first time
//   - Re-run the function on an interval (every 60s?) to update as time changes
//   - Load data for 9AM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 10AM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 11AM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 12PM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 1PM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 2PM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 3PM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 4PM block from localStorage
//   - Load data for 5PM block from localStorage
//   - Update the current date/time at the top of the page
//   - Set up a click handler for the save button:
//     - Get the value from the textarea in the block that is being saved
//     - Get the time (i.e. 9) of the time block that's being saved
//     - Store the value from the textarea in localStorage, using the hour as the key
